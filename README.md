Plan 9 tools implemented in Haskell

## What and why

"Plan 9 from Bell Labs" is an alternative operating system that never
quite caught on. Its proponents believe strongly that Plan 9 offers a
cleaner, more powerful operating system paradigm than Unix. I just
like that there's a nice set of Plan 9 command line tools available at
[http://tools.suckless.org/9base](http://tools.suckless.org/9base)
that really need to be implemented in Haskell.

## Goals

*Simplicity, unity, "inner light".*

Plan 9 tried to out Unix Unix, I want to out Plan 9 Plan 9. But I'm
also doing it POSIX compatibly, so it's really not possible. Instead,
I just hope to use Haskell to create a very clean way of implementing
these Plan 9 tools' functionality.

## Education

This project isn't terribly difficult nor is it useful. The plan
instead is to share ways of thinking about command line tools using
Haskell.
